# Music-App-Prototype
This project was an assignment for my Web222 course. It is a prototype for a fictional Music App. 
It was designed to practice working with HTML and the DOM to create both static and dynamic web content.

Features Genre-Specific Focus: 
The app showcases artists and songs from a specific music genre. 

Dynamic Content: 
Browse artists and search for specific songs using JavaScript-driven interactivity. 

Simulated Database: 
All artist and song data is managed using JavaScript Objects and Arrays, stored in separate files. 

User Interaction: 
A Sign-Up Form for users to subscribe to a newsletter. A New Artist Submission Form for users to suggest artists to be featured. This project emphasizes hands-on experience with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and form handling without relying on external databases.  

Tech Stack:
-HTML5
-CSS 
-JavaScript
